  summary:
    "Pharos activates the identity-bound V9 model with three risk pillars, explicit evidence responsibility, structural ceilings, and fail-closed publication health.",
  impact: [
    "All active consumers select V9 without recomputing or falling back to V8",
    "Backing, Exit, and Economic Control replace the five V8 dimensions for native V9 output",
    "Transient producer failures hold the last accepted V9 snapshot and expose held status instead of publishing infrastructure-attributed score movement",
    "Capability-free immutable protocol contracts resolve to immutable governance access posture instead of being mistaken for concentrated administrators",
    "V8.17 remains available only as historical methodology and archived score history",
